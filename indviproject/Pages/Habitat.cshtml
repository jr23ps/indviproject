                Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) primarily inhabit tropical forests and savannas in Central and West Africa. Their range spans across more than 20 countries, including the Congo Basin, Uganda,
                and Gabon. These highly adaptable primates thrive in a variety of environments, from dense rainforests to open woodlands and grasslands with scattered trees. Chimpanzees rely on their 
                habitats for food, shelter, and social interactions, often building nests in trees for sleeping. Key resources such as fruiting trees, water sources, and abundant foliage are crucial to 
                sustaining their populations. Seasonal changes also influence their movements, as they follow food availability.

                Unfortunately, chimpanzee habitats face increasing threats due to human activities. Deforestation for agriculture, logging, and infrastructure development has led to significant habitat
                loss and fragmentation, making it harder for chimpanzees to find food and maintain social groups. Illegal hunting and poaching compound these challenges, as does disease transmission
                from humans. Conservation efforts, including protected reserves and community-based initiatives, are critical for preserving chimpanzee habitats. By addressing these issues, we can help
                secure the future of these intelligent and endangered primates while maintaining the biodiversity of their ecosystems.
