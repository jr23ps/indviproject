        <h2>About Chimpanzees</h2>
        <div class="col-md-6">       
            <p>
                Chimpanzees are intelligent, social primates found in African rainforests and savannahs. They share about 98% of their DNA with humans, making them one of our closest living relatives.
                These highly sociable animals live in complex groups and use tools, exhibit emotional behaviors, and have intricate social relationships.
                <br /><br />
                Chimpanzees, one of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, have fascinating traits and behaviors that make them truly unique. For starters, chimpanzees are incredibly intelligent and
                have been observed using tools to gather food and solve problems. For example, they craft sticks to extract termites from mounds and even use rocks to crack open nuts. Their cognitive 
                abilities extend to communication, with some chimpanzees, such as Washoe, learning sign language to interact with humans—a skill that showcases their advanced understanding and learning 
                capabilities​.
                <br />
                <br />
                Socially, chimpanzees live in complex, dynamic groups called fission-fusion societies, where group sizes and compositions change frequently. They groom each other to build and maintain 
                relationships, a behavior that underscores their social bonds.

                Additionally, these primates exhibit emotional depth; their ability to empathize with group members and express joy, anger, and fear makes them strikingly similar to humans. 
                Notably, their social interactions include playful antics, which researchers suggest could be a way to strengthen group cohesion​​.

                Chimpanzees also have some quirky and impressive traits. For example, they can make over 30 distinct sounds, including a "pant-hoot" used for long-distance communication. 
                Despite their ground-based knuckle-walking, chimps occasionally walk upright on two legs for short periods. In captivity, some chimpanzees have lived into their 70s, far surpassing the 
                typical wild lifespan of around 40 years. However, their remarkable lives are under threat as they are listed as endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.
