        <h2>Why Chimpanzees Endangered</h2>
        <div class="col-md-6">

            <p>
                Chimpanzees are endangered primarily due to habitat destruction, which results from human activities like deforestation, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure development. 
                These activities reduce the availability of forested areas that chimps rely on for shelter, food, and social living. Additionally, illegal logging and mining in African countries further 
                fragment their habitats, making it challenging for chimpanzee populations to move freely and maintain genetic diversity. The shrinking forest cover also increases the likelihood of 
                human-wildlife conflicts, as chimpanzees venture into human settlements in search of food.

                Another major threat to chimpanzees is poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. While some are hunted for bushmeat, others are captured for sale as exotic pets or for use in entertainment. 
                Moreover, diseases transmitted by humans, such as respiratory infections, pose a severe risk to wild chimpanzees, whose immune systems are not equipped to handle these illnesses. 
                Climate change also exacerbates these issues by altering the ecosystems chimpanzees depend on, leading to further strain on their populations. Conservation efforts, including protected 
                reserves, anti-poaching initiatives, and public education, are critical to ensuring their survival​.

        <h2>How to Help</h2>
        <div class="col-md-6">

            <p>
               To help protect chimpanzees, individuals can support conservation efforts that preserve their natural habitats. One effective way is by contributing to organizations that establish and
               maintain protected areas, ensuring chimpanzees have safe spaces to live and thrive. Encouraging sustainable practices, such as purchasing products that do not contribute to deforestation 
               certified sustainable wood or palm oil, can also reduce the destruction of forests. Furthermore, ecotourism initiatives that involve local communities in conservation efforts provide
               financial incentives to preserve chimpanzee habitats while raising awareness about their plight​.

               Another way to help is by combating the illegal wildlife trade and poaching. Supporting anti-poaching initiatives and spreading awareness about the dangers of keeping chimpanzees as 
               exotic pets can reduce demand for the illegal trade. Educating communities living near chimpanzee habitats on the importance of coexistence and disease prevention can also mitigate 
               human-wildlife conflicts and disease transmission. Lastly, advocating for stronger wildlife protection laws and funding research initiatives can contribute to long-term conservation 
               strategies, ensuring future generations can enjoy and learn from these remarkable primates​.
